# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-05

### Changed
- **Merged the Model and Vocabulary registries into a single Model Registry.** OWL/RDFS ontologies and SKOS vocabularies now live in one registry served under `/api/models`. Each entry carries a `kind` (`data-model` | `vocabulary`), auto-detected from the uploaded RDF on every version upload and surfaced as a badge with an ontology/vocabulary filter in the web UI.
- Publishing stamps version metadata by graph content — OWL `owl:versionIRI` / `owl:priorVersion` for ontologies and DCAT/PAV/SKOS (`dcat:hasVersion`, `pav:version`, `dcterms:issued`/`modified`, `dcterms:isReplacedBy`) for vocabularies — and applies both for mixed packages.
- Per-term dereference (`/api/models/{id}/term`) now also returns the enclosing `skos:ConceptScheme` for SKOS concepts.

### Removed
- The standalone Vocabulary registry: its `/api/vocabularies` endpoints and dedicated web-UI pages. Vocabularies are now managed in the unified Model Registry (pre-1.0 breaking change).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-03

First public, source-available release of **Open Triplestore**.

### Added
- RDF triple store built on [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) with an
  [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) HTTP layer.
- **SPARQL 1.1** (SELECT/CONSTRUCT/ASK/DESCRIBE/UPDATE) and **SPARQL 1.2 / RDF-star**.
- **GeoSPARQL 1.1** (all 30 OGC requirements) via GEOS.
- **OWL 2** reasoning — RDFS, RL/EL/QL profiles natively, plus a DL external-reasoner bridge.
- **SHACL** validation (Core + Advanced), SHACL-on-write, and SHACL Compact Syntax.
- **LDP 1.0**, **RML** mapping, full-text search (Tantivy), and a **DCAT 2 / VoID / ADMS / PROV** catalogue at `/.well-known/void`.
- JWT + API-key authentication, RBAC, OAuth 2.0 / OIDC, optional SAML 2.0 SSO.
- Datasets, organisations/groups, model & vocabulary registries, dataset versioning, and binary asset management with extracted RDF metadata.
- A full-featured **Svelte** web UI, OpenAPI docs/Swagger UI, and a Docker image.
- Bundled **opengraph** engine layer (durable blank-node identity: RDFC-1.0 canonical labels + opt-in Skolemization).
- Optional, configurable **graph-viewer** deep-link integration (off by default; set `VITE_GRAPH_VIEWER_URL`) and a `form-manifest` endpoint for external form platforms.
